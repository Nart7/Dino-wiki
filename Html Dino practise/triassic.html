                <p1 style="font-size: 1.2rem;">The Achelosaurus was a herbivore that lived in the late Cretaceous period and inhabited North America. The
                    generic name
                    Achelousaurus is a complex reference to Greek mythology. Achelous, an important Greek river deity, had
                    one of his horns torn off by Hercules, in a mythological fight with the legendary hero. All three known skulls
                    of
                    Achelousaurus have rough bosses in the same places where other ceratopsians had horns, giving it the appearance
                    of
                    having had its horns ripped off. Achelous was also celebrated for his shapeshifting hability, just as
                    Achelousaurus
                    appears to combine features of other ceratopsian dinosaurs. slkadmnalskmdlkasmd lkamsldkmaslkdmaslkdm  laksmdlkasmdlkasmd lkmaslkdmalskmd lkmaslkdmlaksmd oijg2oiejngwe oiuhgweughopqwurgbn pibqwergunwqepiuhn piuwngpiuwen pgiunwpeiqunpiuwengpiu n nuwegnpiwueg</p1>

        <p1 style="color: white; font-size: 1.2rem;"> At the beginning of the Triassic period, the land masses of the world were still bound together into the vast
        supercontinent known as Pangaea. Pangaea began to break apart in the mid-Triassic, forming Gondwana (South America,
        Africa, India, Antarctica, and Australia) in the south and Laurasia (North America and Eurasia) in the north. The
        movement of the two resulting supercontinents was caused by sea floor spreading at the midocean ridge lying at the
        bottom of the Tethys Sea, the body of water between Gondwana and Laurasia. While Pangaea was breaking apart, mountains
        were forming on the west coast of North America by subduction of the ocean plates beneath the continental plates.
        Throughout the Middle to Late Triassic, mountain forming continued along the coast extending from Alaska to Chile. As
        mountains were forming on the Americas, North Africa was being split from Europe by the spreading rift. This division of
        the continents advanced further westward, eventually splitting eastern North America from North Africa. <br> <br> The climate of the Triassic era was influenced by Pangaea, its centralized position stradling the equator, and the
        geologic activity associated with its breakup. Generally speaking, the continents were of high elevation compared to sea
        level, and the sea level did not change drastically during the period. Due to the low sea level, flooding of the
        continents to form shallow seas did not occur. Much of the inland area was isolated from the cooling and moist effects
        of the ocean. The result was a globally arid and dry climate, though regions near the coast most likely experienced
        seasonal monsoons. There were no polar ice caps, and the temperature gradient in the north-south direction is assumed to
        have been more gradual than present day. The sea level rose as the rift grew between North Africa and southern Europe,
        resulting in the flooding of Central and South Europe; the climates of terrestrial Europe were hot and dry, as in the
        Permian. Overall, it appears that the climate included both arid dune environments and moist river and lake habitats
        with gymnosperm forests.</p1>
